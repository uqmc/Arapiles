      <h1 className={styles.centered}>The University of Queensland Mountain Club</h1>
      <p> className={styles.centered}UQMC is a bunch of physed young people that enjoy
adventuring in the outdoors. The club organises a bunch of climbing, hiking, camping and social trips.
UQMC is a volunteer-run organisation which is affiliated with UQ sport. The best thing about the
club is the friends you make; you will meet plenty of people who will help you learn to climb, be your
belay buddy, or go on that hiking trip. Being a part of this community will inspire you to adventure
further and always be a weekend warrior.</p>
