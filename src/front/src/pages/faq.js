      <h2 className={styles.question}>How does the club run?</h2>
      <p>The club is a volunteer-run organisation which is affiliated with UQ sport. It is essential that as a
member you give back to the UQMC community, if you learn to climb with us please help us pass the
knowledge onto the new member. Without a cycle of giving back and passing your experience on
our club is not sustainable. If your not keen be apart of the community and just want to learn to
climb, we would suggest you check out the courses our friend at Pinnacle Sports offer.</p>

      <h2 className={styles.question}>I don’t know anything about climbing, can I still join?</h2>
      <p>Yes. We have a community that will help you learn the skills you need to know to climb safely. We
do not offer any formal certificates, and our volunteers are not outdoor guides; however, our
activity leaders have vertical rescue and first aid Check out our “tape system” to see the skills
progression program the club uses.</p>

      <h2 className={styles.question}>I don’t have any climbing gear can I still come?</h2>
      <p>Yes. Your membership fees go towards having essential gear so that new members have access to
the equipment they need. However, we do suggest that as you progress thought the club, you buy
your climbing equipment (harness, shoes, personal safeties, e.t.c.) and if your keen to climb ofter
your rope and gear. Having your gear will be super helpful when you want to organise your own trip
with the new friend you met because life-critical club gear (i.e. climbing equipment) cannot be
borrowed it only allowed to be used on club trips where members are under the supervision of
activity leaders and experienced members.</p>
